I'm a Web/AR/VR/XR developer, working for the University of Southern Queensland (USQ ) in the Office for the Advancement of Learning & Teaching (OALT).

I make interactive and immersive activities that promote learning and engagement for students, helping them get the most from their course, and helping examiners build more meaningful tertiary education experiences.

I also make the reasonable popular **GitCDN**
